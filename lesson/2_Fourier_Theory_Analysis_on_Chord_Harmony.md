## Harmonic Analysis

### Factors Affecting Harmony
1. Frequency ratio simplicity
2. Harmonic overlap degree
3. Beat phenomena occurrence

### Fourier Components

    

Fundamental: f
2nd Harmonic: 2f
3rd Harmonic: 3f
4th Harmonic: 4f

    

### Wave Interaction

    

Constructive interference: reinforcement
Destructive interference: cancellation
Beat frequency = |f₁ - f₂|
