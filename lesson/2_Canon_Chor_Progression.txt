Canon Chord Progression

The standard Canon chord progression (also known as Pachelbel's Canon) is:

C - G - Am - Em - F - C - F - G

or in Roman numerals:
I - V - vi - iii - IV - I - IV - V

This is one of the most famous chord progressions in Western music, originally from Johann Pachelbel's Canon in D (where it's played in the key of D: D - A - Bm - F#m - G - D - G - A).

The progression is widely used in popular music because of its pleasing and natural-sounding harmonic movement. Many modern songs can be adapted to use this chord progression, which is why it's often called the "magical progression" in popular music.
